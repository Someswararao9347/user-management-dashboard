# User Management Dashboard

A simple React-based user management dashboard that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete user details using the JSONPlaceholder API. This project demonstrates how to build a clean, interactive user interface while handling asynchronous operations like fetching and updating data.

## Features

- View a list of users fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Add a new user to the list.
- Edit details of an existing user.
- Delete a user from the list.
- Clean and responsive UI using React.

## Features to Improve
Form Validation: Implement more robust validation in the user form, such as email validation and required fields.
Pagination: If the user data grows, consider implementing pagination or lazy loading for better performance.
Error Handling: Improve user experience by adding visual indicators or toast notifications when errors occur.
UI Enhancements: Add confirmations for destructive actions like deletion and success notifications after CRUD operations.
Challenges Faced
Fetching and Handling Errors: Dealing with API errors and ensuring proper error handling in asynchronous operations.
State Management: Managing complex states like modal visibility and ensuring updates to the user list in a way that avoids unnecessary re-renders.
